# Disclaimer

Note that this is for my personal use (used with Pop OS).

All I did was modify the styling of the Ultimate-Punk-GTK gnome shell (see https://github.com/rtlewis88/rtl88-Themes/tree/Ultimate-Punk-Complete-Desktop/Ultimate-PUNK-GTK/gnome-shell) for the purpose of accompanying the original GTK3 theme "oomox Pandora Arc" (see https://github.com/themix-project/oomox && https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1352568/)

# Prerequisite

You will need gnome tweak tool to make this work. I made this work under the Pop! OS environment - not sure how accomodating it is with other linux OSes.

# Installation

1. Create a .themes folder in your home directory, if you haven't yet  
  
>>  `cd ~ && mkdir .themes`
  
2. Clone and copy the entire folder over to .themes folder  
  
>>  `sudo cp -af <folderName> ~.themes`
  
3. Set your active gnome shell and theme with gnome tweak tool
