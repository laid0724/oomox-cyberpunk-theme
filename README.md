# Disclaimer

Note that this is for my personal use (used with Pop OS) - all I did was hack together a gnome shell for the purpose of accompanying the original GTK3 theme "oomox Pandora Arc" - see https://github.com/themix-project/oomox && https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1352568/

# Prerequisite

You will need gnome tweak tool to make this work. I made this work under the Pop! OS environment. 

# Installation

1. Create a .themes folder in your home directory, if you haven't yet

`cd ~ && mkdir .themes`

2. Clone and copy the entire folder over to .themes folder
`sudo cp -af <folderName> ~.themes`

3. Set your active gnome shell and theme with gnome tweak tool
